# Haccess simple tool example configuration file
#
# Ben Dooks <ben@hacman.org.uk> <ben@fluff.org>

# This example is a simple tool configuration that does not need
# any authentication. The haccess node allows the tool to be turned
# on, and off. The sources for on/off are either the two buttons on
# the front, or via mqtt control (such as space off or emergency stop)
